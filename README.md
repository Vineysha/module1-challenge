# module1-challenge: Horiseon Marketing Agency

## Description

This marketing agency was having issues with accessibility standards. I was asked to take this existing code and refactor it to make it accessible. Along with fixing the accessibility issues, I also solved a bug in one of the search links, organized some images, and  changed the fonts of texts to make it easier to read. Furthermore, while working on this project I learned the importance of well organized code and how helful it is to comment on it, not just for myself but for the next developer that views it.
